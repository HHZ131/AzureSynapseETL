# AzureSynapseETL

# Azure Architecture Demonstration

## Project Overview  
This project is a demonstration of the Azure-based ETL architecture implemented at KE Holdings. It showcases how cloud solutions were designed to support data processing, analytics, and business intelligence workflows.  

## Architecture Components  
### Data Ingestion  
- Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) stores raw venture monthly operational records.  

### Data Organization  
- A Lake Database is used to further organize and structure the data.  

### Data Processing  
- A Synapse Pipeline executes the ETL process using PySpark and T-SQL.  

### Data Storage  
- Cleaned data is loaded into Dedicated SQL Pools or Synapse Warehousing for analytical processing and reporting.  

### Data Visualization  
- Power BI dashboards present business insights to stakeholders for decision-making.  

## Deployment & Version Control  
- GitHub is used for version control of Synapse Notebooks, SQL scripts, and ETL pipelines.  
- Future implementation may include Azure DevOps Pipelines for CI/CD automation.
